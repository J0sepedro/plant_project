            <p>the Durfee Conservatory at UMass Amherst is an amazing place to be due to its beautiful plants, educational opportunities, relaxing atmosphere, community involvement, and historical significance. <strong>(I spent many hours in here right as it opened at 10:00AM and personally found it mesmerizing and relaxing. I intend on one day having a conservatory like this of my own.)</strong></p>
